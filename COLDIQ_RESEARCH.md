3. **Providing integration depth** that ColdIQ doesn't (exactly how to connect tools to GHL)
4. **Targeting GHL agencies specifically** rather than general B2B sales teams

The tools from ColdIQ that are most valuable to GHL owners are those that **supplement GHL's capabilities** (video, data enrichment, advanced email deliverability) rather than **replace them** (CRM, basic email, landing pages).
